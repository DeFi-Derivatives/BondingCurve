# BondingCurve

## Usage 

Decentralized Method for Raising Funds for Governance Token. 


## Dual Token Bonding Curve 

In Order to Purchase the Governance Token, Users would have to deposit XTZ as well USD tokens. 


- USD Tokens helps in the price stability aspect 
- XTZ does bring in some external volatility with constant staking rewards for Development Fund. 

Since, the Dex Contract of Quipuswap would contain DAO-XTZ, and bonding curve depends on XTZ and USD, 
it raises opportunities for arb for it's holders. 

## How Tezos makes Bonding Curves Interesting

funds being recieved from staking for the Development of the Project.
